# BPoNW
BurnPoNW ($BPoNW) token has a fixed total supply & can only be minted by burning Proof of No Work ($PoNW) tokens. Once minted, $BPoNW can be used to mine $PLS, PulseChain's native gas token. The $PLS is gathered from $BPoNW minters, who are charged a $PLS fee ontop of their $PoNW burn in order to mint $BPoNW. This means there is no need to sell the $BPoNW to fund the mining, putting no inherent sell pressure on $BPoNW token ðŸš€.
